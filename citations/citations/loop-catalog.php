        <p>Curating HiChIP and ChIP-seq Samples</p>
        <p>To identify a comprehensive list of publicly-released HiChIP datasets, we developed a pipeline that scans NCBIâ€™s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (Barrett et al., 2013) for studies performing HiChIP experiments. To extract information on these studies the BioPython.Entrez (Buchmann & Holmes, 2019) and metapub.convert (https://pypi.org/project/metapub/) packages were used. Raw sequencing data associated to these studies was then identified from the SRA database using the pysradb Python package (https://github.com/saketkc/pysradb) and the results were manually examined to extract HiChIP samples. ChIP-seq samples corresponding to these studies were also extracted if there was a record of them within the same GEO ID as the HiChIP sample.</p>
