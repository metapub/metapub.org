        <p>Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 6834 7 of 19 4.1. Data Preprocessing Around eight drugs are analyzed with this model. For this purpose, abstracts from each document are collected, as they provide the accurate and necessary information about the paper. The PubMed abstracts have a unique ID called PMID. The metapub li-brary in python gets these IDs as input and extracts their corresponding abstracts. The number of document abstracts collected for each drug from PubMed is given in Table 1. Table 1. Number of documents collected from PubMed for each drug.</p>
