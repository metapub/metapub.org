    <blockquote>
        <p>We started from a curated list of 813 compounds of interest for the three projects composing ASPIS (https://aspis-cluster.eu/). This list groups different types of compounds associated with one or multiple adverse outcomes of interest to one of the projects from the cluster, including cholestasis and steatosis. In the case of cholestasis and steatosis, these were selected by based on literature. For each compound, we programmatically retrieved a maximum of the first 100 abstracts found by querying PubMed for: compound name AND toxic* AND (human OR Animals, Laboratory OR Disease Models, Animal). For that purpose we used the Python packages metapub (v0.5.5) for querying and biopython (v1.79) for text retrieval. The query was restricted to 100 abstracts because of computational resources and because we intended to carry out a proof of concept. No minimum number of abstracts per compound was defined, however we analyzed how many were found for each compound (see results section). Duplicate abstracts were removed.</p>
