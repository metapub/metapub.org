    <blockquote>
        <p>"The first phase of the workflow (phase I) covers the aim of building a database of the JSON format containing parsed PDFs (Figure 1). This phase consists of five steps. The first stepâ€™s objective is to fetch the PubMed IDs related to the search query. This is accomplished by using the PubMed fetcher function available through the Metapub python library. This step uses the input query to search for recent PubMed articles that match the query terms. After that, in the second step, the workflow fetches the abstracts and keywords of the retrieved PubMed IDs. This is achieved through the use of the python library Keybert. The third step in this phase involves downloading the identified PDFs; this is done using the fetch_PDFs library."</p>
